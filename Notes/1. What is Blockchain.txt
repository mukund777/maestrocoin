Blockchain is a growing list of records, called blocks, that are linked together by cryptography. 
Each block contains 
	1. Transactional data
	2. Hash of previous block
	3. Timestamp : proves that the transaction data existed when the block was published inorder to get into it's hash. 
	4. Hash of block. 
List of blocks linked together using cryptography is called a blockchain. 
The concept of Blockchain was introduced by Stuart Haber and W.Scott Stornetta.
Genesis block is the first block. Hash of the genesis block is 0000000000. 
Blockchain is immutable meaning that if the transactional data is changed, this will result in a change in the hash of the block. This will result in a hash mismatch, 
thereby blockchain is resistant to modifications in data.
