Three challenges faced by blockchain: 
1. If an attacker manages to change a block in a node, will the other nodes be able to detect this? 
2. If an attacker can add a new malicious block at the end of the blockchain, will other nodes be able to detect that, and can blockchain overcome that?
3. All nodes are geographically distributed. If a node adds a new block into the blockchain, it takes time to propagate it to the other nodes. 
   In the time it takes to propagate, if another node adds a new block, how will you distinguish which block is to be added and which not to?

There are aspects of the consensus protocol: 
	1. Proof of Work: When the miner comes up with the required hash, it is proof that he has done the work. 
	2. Proof of stake. 
	3. Others. 

How do you ensure that the correct transactions are added to the blockchain? 
	1. Mining fees: Miners get paid by the parties in the transaction to add blocks into the network. 
	   Hence they ensure that the correct details are added to the blockchain. 
    
When an attacker adds a malicious block at the end of the blockchain? 
	1. Other blocks will come up with their own/correct version of the blockchain and the miner with the malicious block will lose their reward.  
	2. If a block is added, the other miners will verify that block by performing checks according to the consensus protocol. 
	   The cryptographic puzzle is hard to solve but easy to verify. 

Verification of hash is easy: block details and nonce are hashed, and the hash obtained by miner is compared with hash obtained by other nodes. 
Consensus protocols use economic incentives to overcome technical problems => give rewards to ensure that miners mine the correct information.
