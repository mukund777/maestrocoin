Content of a block: 
	1. Block number
	2. Data
	3. Previous hash 
	4. Hash of block => Hash of 1,2 and 3. We don't have control of 1,2 and 3
	5. Nonce: Used to manipulate value of hash for extra control or flexibility.  
Number Used Once: Nonce. 
Change in Nonce changes to value of the hash of the block. 
Miners must find the nonce that produces the hash that satisfies some criteria. 
The task of the miner is to take 1,2,3 and manipulate the nonce to get a hash that satisfies a particular criterion.
