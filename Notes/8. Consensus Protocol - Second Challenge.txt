When two miners come up with two blocks and propagate them, depending on the speed of the propagation, some parts of the network have block from the first miner and 
other parts from the second miner. 
This leads to a conflict. 
According to the consensus protocol, the longest blockchain is the king. 
The longest blockchain will be replicated across all nodes. 
In either case, the block which is part of the longest chain will be added to the network while the other block will be orphaned. 
This block will be called the orphaned block. 
The person who mined the orphaned block will lose his reward. 
The solution is to wait for 6 blocks to be added then add your block. 
Only 50 percent of the network needs to be honest to come to an agreement.
