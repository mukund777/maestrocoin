How will the software look like? 
The software must be run by the nodes and the client. 
Architecture : 
1. P2P network: set of nodes, each node must be able to talk to any other nodes and must maintain their own copy of the blockchain.
2. Each node must contain a set of transactions carried out by the users. Each node will receive a list of transactions and the nodes must mine it. 
3. Reward for successfully mining a node is 1 coin. 
4. Nodes should have a consensus protocol to have a unified version of the blockchain. 
5. Clients/users should be able to interact with the network and send over transactions. 
	a.Software should allow users to generate public and private keys for their wallets.
	b. Transactions must be sent from the user to every node in the network. The value should be in the transaction. 
	   The sender will be the public key of the user and the receiver will be any other public key in the network. 
	c. The software should allow the users to view any transaction present in the blockchain.
