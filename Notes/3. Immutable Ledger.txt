Blocks are cryptographically linked together. 
For validation of blockchain, previous hash of present block should be equal to hash of previous block. 
For traditional ledgers, all data is stored at a single point, thereby changes to data in that point is permanent and irreversible. 
In the case of blockchain, all blocks are linked together. If a block is changed, previous hash and hash will not be same. 
This will lead to a chain reaction of incorrect blocks thereby rendering the blockchain invalid.  
Change in one block will require changes in the subsequent blocks which takes time and resources. 
The blockchain is shared amoung many nodes and all nodes must agree with eachother for the blockchain to be validated.
