Varying the hash means changing the nonce value. 
Greater the leading 0's in hex rep of hash, smaller the length of decimal value of the hash. 
Objective of mining is to find a hash that is less than or equal to a given target. 
Target is expressed with leading zeroes. 
For example, the hash must have 4 leading 0's => 0000XXXXX is the representation of the hash. 
Miners have to change the nonce, calculate the hash of the block and check whether the hash is below the target. 
If the hash value is greater than the target, change the nonce value and repeat the process. 
If the hash value is less than the target, the miner wins, he can add the block to the blockchain and get rewarded. 
Adding a block must be made as difficult as possible, else miners can easily add blocks to the blockchain and that defeats the whole purpose of blockchain. 
Beauty of avalanche effect is that a single change in the nonce will lead to a drastic change in the hash value. 
Due to this, miners cannot find patterns and predict the value of the hash based on the value of the nonce. 
We cannot reverse engineer the hash. We cannot predict the hash based on the input. 
That is, we cannot predict the hash based on the value of the nonce. 
All miners/nodes in the P2P Network will have the transaction details and must mine the block and win to add the block in the blockchain. 
Miners/Nodes have to get lucky to be able to mine the block.
